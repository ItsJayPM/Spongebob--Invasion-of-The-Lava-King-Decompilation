# Spongebob: Invasion of The Lava King Decompilation
## A full reverse engineering of the game's code that can be recompiled
 Should be pretty accurate to the original game, and ontop of that has the level builder enabled, and can be fully utilized with MDM Zinc (Installation of which will not be detailed within this repo). It's worth noting that only the first map is included in the data folder. If you know a place where the rest of the maps can be downloaded at mass, please tell me!

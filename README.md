# Spongebob: Invasion of The Lava King Decompilation
## A full decompilation of the game's source code that can be recompiled, done with JPEXS and manually fixed and cleaned up by hand
 Should be pretty accurate to the original game, and ontop of that has the level builder enabled, and can be fully utilized with MDM Zinc (Installation of which will not be detailed within this repo). All maps are also included.
